/*Multi Line Comment - Javascript needs data, programming doesn't work without it. Theres different data types

For example, the first ones are Variables & Constants

*/

var favoriteshow = "Dr. House";
console.log(favoriteshow) // => "Dr. House"

// preferred data type that is similar to var is let, and you should be using it with variables. For constants you can use const //

let fridge = "empty";
console.log(fridge) // => "empty"
fridge = "full"
console.log (fridge) // => "full"

// Variables rules: 1. names are case-sensitive, 2. variables should begin with a lowercase character
// Variables rules 3. Variables cannot begin with a number
// Variables cannot contain symbols
// camelCased variable names are BEST PRACTICE

let favFood;
let camelCasedVariable;
let userName;

// NO

let favoriterestaurant

// Constants cannot be changed 

const myCodingConfidence = "unwavering"

console.log("My confidence in my coding is" +  " " + myCodingConfidence)
