/*
Declare a function 'Queue', which takes in no arguments and returns an instance of a 'Queue' object when invoked with the 'new' keyword.
'Queue' objects should function similarly to an Array - i.e., they will store values at numbered indexes, starting at 0.
All Queue objects should contain their own 'length' property, which keeps track of the number of items they contain. When a Queue is first created, it should have a length of 0.
